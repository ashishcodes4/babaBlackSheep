				<p>We opened our first Café in 2011 in Little Tokyo-Downtown Los Angeles, with the understanding that the best moments of any day are the positive interactions we have with friends, community and sometimes even strangers.  This is very important to us.  We believe that we can have a positive impact simply by how we serve people.</p>
				<p>Everything we do from choosing a special coffee, to experimenting with creative donuts and hand-tossing kale salads is done with the notion that we will be serving our guest. We’ve curated the best coffee roasters from around the world and have created an extensive beverage, bakery and food menu that is truly unique to Dulce.</p>
				<p>We hope you enjoy the few minutes or hours you spend with us at Café Dulce sipping a latte or sharing bacon donuts with good company. And most importantly, thank you for being awesome. :)</p>
